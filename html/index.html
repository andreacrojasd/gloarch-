				<p>Globalization has undoubtedly played a significant role in shaping the modern world. While it has brought numerous benefits, such as increased connectivity and economic growth, it has also perpetuated unfair uses of money and resources. This has resulted in the creation of absurd contrasts in cities and other areas.
					One of the primary ways globalization has contributed to these disparities is through the concentration of wealth and power in certain regions. As global markets have expanded, multinational corporations and wealthy individuals have been able to exploit resources and labor in developing countries, often at the expense of local communities. This has led to the extraction of natural resources, environmental degradation, and exploitation of workers, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and inequality.
					Moreover, globalization has facilitated the flow of capital across borders, allowing for large-scale investments in infrastructure and development projects. While this has undoubtedly contributed to economic growth in certain areas, it has also resulted in the neglect and marginalization of other regions. Cities have become centers of economic activity, attracting investments and opportunities, while rural and less-developed areas struggle to keep up. This has created stark contrasts between urban and rural environments, with cities becoming symbols of prosperity and progress, while other areas are left behind.
					Furthermore, globalization has fueled consumerism and the pursuit of material wealth, exacerbating the disparities between the haves and the have-nots. As the global economy becomes increasingly interconnected, advertising and media promote a certain lifestyle and standard of living that is often unattainable for many. This has led to a culture of conspicuous consumption and inequality, where the gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen. </p>

																								<p>Globalization has had a profound impact on urban layouts and spaces, leading to both positive and negative effects. On one hand, globalization has fueled the creation of more efficient urban layouts by promoting connectivity and interdependence among cities. This has facilitated the development of well-planned and integrated spaces that cater to the diverse needs of residents and businesses.
																									Through globalization, cities have become hubs of economic activity, attracting investments and fostering innovation. This has resulted in the emergence of modern infrastructures, such as transportation networks and smart technologies, that enhance efficiency and convenience in urban living. Additionally, globalization has encouraged the exchange of ideas and best practices in urban planning, allowing cities to learn from each other and implement effective strategies for optimizing space utilization.
																									However, it is important to acknowledge that globalization has also had negative consequences, particularly in the form of gentrification. As cities become more interconnected and desirable, certain neighborhoods undergo rapid transformation, leading to the displacement of lower-income residents and the loss of cultural diversity. Gentrification often results in rising property prices, making it difficult for marginalized communities to afford housing in their own neighborhoods.
																									Furthermore, the quest for efficiency and economic growth driven by globalization can sometimes overshadow the importance of social equity and inclusivity in urban development. This can lead to the prioritization of profit-driven projects that cater to the needs of the affluent, while neglecting the well-being and livability of all residents.</p>
